# Node-RED Nodes

A collection of nodes for Node-RED.

## Installation

Eventually, the nodes will be npm-installable, but we're not there yet. Until then:

1. cd into the `nodes` directory of Node-RED
2. Either:
  - download the zip of the repository and extract
  - run `git clone https://github.com/node-red/node-red-nodes.git`
3. npm install any of the individual node dependencies

This is all too manually, so the sooner we npm-enable this stuff the better

## Contributing

Please read the Contributing section of the main project [README](https://github.com/node-red/node-red/blob/master/README.md)

The key points are:
 - try to follow the conventions we use (all undocumented at the moment just to make it interesting)
 - focus on the UX of the node - make it simple to do simple things and simple to do advanced things. Don't
   force a user wanting to do simple things have to wade through the advanced things.
 - avoid duplication
